<h1>Travel index</h1>
<p>The Travel Index uses a panel of GPS signals representing road trips taken specifically in cars (excludes travel by air). A trip is measured as one where the user has traveled a minimum of 50 miles and spent a minimum of 2 hours at the destination. Commuter travel or other frequently repeated trips (ie cargo deliveries or other reoccurring activities) are excluded from the Daily Travel Index. The Daily Travel Index includes all dates from October 1, 2019 to current day.</p>
